CONCLUSION  \\nThe challenge of detecting metamorphic malware remains \\na pressing issue in the field of information security. This study \\nproposes a novel deep learning-based approach using  \\nBidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to detect metamorphic \\nmalware based on attack vectors. The performance of \\nBiLSTM is compared against other recurrent neural networks \\n(RNNs) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and \\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as a hybrid model of \\nBiLSTM and GRU. The models are trained on a \\ncomprehensive dataset containing eight categories of \\nmetamorphic malware. The results demonstrate that BiLSTM \\noutperforms other RNNs with the highest accuracy of 93.25%. \\nThis approach could significantly enhance current m alware \\ndetection techniques and improve the overall securi ty of \\ncomputer systems. By focusing on utilizing attack v ectors \\nbased on API calls, the research contributes a prac tical and \\neffective approach to detect metamorphic malware in  real-\\nworld scenarios. This practicality enhances the app licability \\nof the proposed method and reinforces its potential  for \\nimplementation in diverse information security syst ems. \\nWhile the paper focuses on metamorphic malware, the  \\nproposed approach can be extended to detect and cla ssify \\nother types of malware and cyber threats. This flexibility and \\ngeneralizability expand the impact of this work bey ond the \\nspecific problem of metamorphic malware, contributing to the \\nbroader field of malware detection. Additionally, this method \\ncould be extended to other types of malware and cyber threats. \\nOne limitation of this study is the reliance on a s pecific \\ndataset, which may not fully capture the diversity and \\ncomplexity of metamorphic malware encountered in re al-\\nworld scenarios but future research can explore mor e \\nadvanced deep learning models to improve detection accuracy \\nand the development of more comprehensive datasets for \\ntraining and testing. \\nR\\nEFERENCES  \\n[1]  Javaheri, D., Lalbakhsh, P., & Hosseinzadeh, M.
